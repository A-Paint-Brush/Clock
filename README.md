This is a simple analog clock program.

## Installation

Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install necessary packages.

## How to Use

Press space to turn the alarm on or off. Tap or hold the left arrow key to rotate the grey hand leftwards. The alarm will go off when the hour hand passes over the grey hand. When the alarm goes off, either turn off the alarm or press the 's' key to snooze the alarm for 5 minutes.

## Credits

I drew all the images myself. But I made this project a long time ago, so I've forgotten where I downloaded the `./Sounds/Alarm Clock Beeping.wav` sound file from.
